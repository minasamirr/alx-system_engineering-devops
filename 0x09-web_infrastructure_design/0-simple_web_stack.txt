    User Accesses Website:
        A user types www.foobar.com into their web browser.

    Domain Name:
        The domain name (foobar.com) acts as a human-readable alias for the server's IP address (8.8.8.8). It helps users access the website without needing to remember the IP address.

    DNS Records:
        The DNS record "www" in www.foobar.com is a CNAME (Canonical Name) record that points to the domain foobar.com, which, in turn, resolves to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8).

    Server:
        The server (physical or virtual machine) hosts all components of the web infrastructure: web server, application server, and database.

    Web Server (Nginx):
        Nginx acts as the web server, receiving HTTP requests from users' browsers and serving static content or routing dynamic requests to the application server. Its role is to handle incoming HTTP requests efficiently.

    Application Server:
        The application server executes the server-side code (e.g., PHP, Python, Node.js) that generates dynamic content based on user requests. It communicates with the web server to process and deliver dynamic content back to the user.

    Application Files:
        The application files contain the code base (e.g., PHP files, Python scripts) responsible for generating dynamic content and processing user requests. These files reside on the server and are executed by the application server.

    Database (MySQL):
        MySQL serves as the relational database management system (RDBMS) storing and managing the website's data. It stores user information, content, and other necessary data for the website's functionality.

    Communication with User's Computer:
        The server communicates with the user's computer over the Internet using the HTTP protocol. When a user requests www.foobar.com, their browser sends an HTTP request to the server, which then responds with the requested web pages or data.

Issues with this Infrastructure:

    Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
        Since all components are hosted on a single server, any failure in the server hardware or software can lead to downtime for the entire website.

    Downtime During Maintenance:
        Performing maintenance tasks such as deploying new code or updating server configurations requires restarting the web server, leading to downtime during the maintenance window.

    Limited Scalability:
        The infrastructure may struggle to handle a sudden increase in incoming traffic beyond the capacity of the single server. Scaling up resources (e.g., adding more CPU, RAM) or distributing the workload across multiple servers becomes challenging in this setup.
